        Are electric vehicles (EV) really greener and environmentally-friendly? They seem to be a great solution to fight climate change and they are even said to have zero emissions. They have also been suggested by many goverments throughout the world which are looking to move to electric vehicles instead of diesel/petrol based vehicles. in this webpage we look at if it is worth it to have electric vehicles? and Is it true that they are harmless to the planet?<br>

    <h2>
        what are electric vehicles?
    </h2>
    <p>
        An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. It can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or it can be powered autonomously by a battery (sometimes charged by solar panels, or by converting fuel to electricity using fuel cells or a generator). EVs include, but are not limited to, road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.

        The main differences between conventional cars and electric vehicles?

    <p>
        The image above shows some differences that can be seen between a electric vehicle vs a conventional vehicle. The fundamental difference between conventional, thermal cars and electric cars has to do with the process of transforming the potential (stored) energy into kinetic (movement) energy.  In thermal cars, this energy is stored in a chemical form and is released through a chemical reaction inside the engine.

    <br>
    Are electric vehicles harmless to the planet?
</h2>
<p>
    No, we cannot say they are completly environmentally-friendly. This can be concluded because even though they do have zero emissions whilst running. We can see through the wheel to barrel analysis that the vehicles could cause potentially more issues to the environment than convential vehicles.<br> 
    
    Electric vehicles might emit CO2 in 3 other stages: during manufacturing, energy production and at the end of their life cycle. In the first case, the need for mining activities to extract the rare earth metals that are used in batteries is very energy consuming and polluting.another example would be the burning of fossil fuels to get electricity for the vehicle.
